        <br>
        <p>Glass frogs are a group of approximately 160 species that appear translucent. When looking at the glass frog's belly, the inside of its body is visible, allowing clear view of its beating heart and food passing through its digestive system. This adaptation allows glass frogs to blend into their environment to make it difficult for predators to catch them.</p>
